# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is a placeholder for the function input and an argument is the data that is passed in the function when it is called that will replace the parameter. 

Researched answer: A parameter is a placeholder variable that is defined inside the parantheses, which can give it leverage inside the function. An argument must be a data type recognized by JavaScript, it is the actual content passed to the function invocation. This process helps maintain encapsulation for proper functionality. 

2. What is the difference between an object and a class? 

Your answer: An object is a collection of things, while a class is a template/blueprint for objects. 

Researched answer: Objects consist of collections of key value pairs. They are the intersection of data and behavior. Classes on the other hand are a type of function that contain data and behavior. The naming convention for classes are PascalCased, however the instance of classes are lowercase. 

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: Repeating an desired action a specific number of times before a condtion is met. 
 
Researched answer: The repetitive process of executing a code block until a condition is met. There are certain data types that meant for iterations such as arrays and strings. An example of iteration is a For loop. 

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Researched answer: Hoisting is the default behaivor that was built into JavaScript that moves functions and variables to the top of the scope. It's important to use the correct variable names such as let and const to avoid any automatic hoisting issues. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Spread operator: Uses the syntax (...) to allow iterables to be expanded in places where more arguments are expected. For example when a function is expecting multiple arrays with multiple elements, the spread operator can be used to concise the code typed inside the argument. 

2. React: A JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. React uses reusable pieces of code called components to build apps and web pages. Each component contains its own functionality. It was created by Facebook and became very popular as it is extremely efficient and scalable. 

3. JSX: Is the extension that we use for React files. It is a building block of React components to allow user interface creation. The syntax is slightly different from HTML so that it doesn't get confused with JavaScript syntax.
